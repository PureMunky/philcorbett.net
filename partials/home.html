  <h3>Goal</h3>
  <p class="left">
    I believe that technology is about connecting with people and inspiring them;
    it is about sharing experiences and sharing knowledge. My goal is to improve
    my relationships and help others do the same through the use, propagation, and
    expansion of technology in a way that is smart, tactful, and positive.
