    <h2>Enough Excuses</h2>

    <p>Today I'm starting something a little different, I'm keeping track of my excuses.</p>

    <p>There are so many times that I've tried to create new habits or start new things and fail for one reason or
      another. I almost always start this process by looking at my available free time, trying to optimize my schedule
      where I can, and then putting that schedule into a calendar with notifications. All this effort put forth and then
      when the rubber hits the road I just ignore the calendar and swipe away its notifications.</p>

    <p>I'm starting the same way I always do but I'm adding one more thing to it. I want to make myself write down why I
      didn't do a thing that I've scheduled for myself; I'm trying to outsmart my future self. I'm adding to this a list
      of things that I want to make sure I do like running a few times a week, writing (like this blog), connecting with
      friends, and yoga almost every day. To help me keep track of these excuse, I've set up a Google form that asks
      what activity I was planning on doing and then why I didn't do it and added this link to each calendar item so
      that I can just click the link without much effort.</p>

    <p>What do I plan to do with these excuses? Well, I thought about posting them on Facebook or Twitter but realized
      that would just keep me from writing them in the first place. So, at the moment, I just plan to look at them
      periodically and try to figure out if they're real or fake. Ideally, if they're real, then I might just find new
      times for the activities. I suspect most of them are actually fake though and I want to get that realistic view of
      who I am so that I can be better.</p>

    <p>If I had to take a guess why this would fail it's because I'm going to not want to spend the time writing the
      "why" but only time will tell.</p>
